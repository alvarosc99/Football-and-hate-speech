# T-tests

All: 

```{r}

s<-split(viz$Proportion,viz$match) #splits the variable price in two groups by gender

#first step: test for equal variances
var.test(s$`0`, s$`1`, alternative = "two.sided")
#second step: test for differences of means, knowing that variances are different
t.test(s$`0`, s$`1` ,alternative="two.sided",mu=0,var.equal=FALSE)  ##The only thing that changes is the last part, var.equal has to be =FALSE. 
##It also gives the difference's confidence interval --> In this case it's + (both values), so males's proportion is greater. 
```
